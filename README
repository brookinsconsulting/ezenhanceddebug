It can help you to see how fast (or slow) your templates are.

Extension features :
- template operators/function profiling
- template operators/function filtering (when you do not want to profile some template operators)
- statistics on your code :
+ median time
+ average time
+ slowest fetch (+ code)
+ number of cache-blocks
+ border on cache-blocks so you know where they are
- you can also see a particular piece of code by clicking on the "Show Code" text.

To install please read the file "INSTALL"
Note 1 : This extension is supposed to be used during development phases, never ever use this extension on production servers, or use it at your own risks !!!!!!
Note 2 : As you might notice I suck at UI design. the extension looks ugly, I am open to any comment to improve the extension's design.
